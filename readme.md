Now install all the dependancies for this project by simply opening an integrated Terminal by selecting the options "Terminal > New Terminal" which will open the new integrated Terminal below, inside which use the command "npm install" to install all the dependancies & the "node_modules" folder in the "chatty-kathy" root directory.

4. Now after successfully installing all the dependancies for the project's 'root' directory, then move to the "client" directory by using the command "cd client", & then run command "npm install" their to install all the required dependancies for the "client" folder. Similarly, repeat this "dependancy install" process for the "server" folder too by moving up the "client" folder first by using commmand "cd .." & then "cd server" & then "npm install" there to install & update dependancies & "node_modules" folder there also.

5. Now open 2 new integrated Terminals by selecting the options "Terminal > New Terminal" 2 times.

8. Now, after successfully moving to "client" folder in the 1st terminal window simply use the command "npm start" to run the react server in your current browser/client, which will open the UI of the "login" page in your browser.

9. Now simply copy the URL of this "login" page which you opened, & open another new browser window & paste this URL which you copied in this new Browser window's searchbar & press enter to open it here also. So, now you successfully opened 2 "login" pages in 2 different browsers.

10. Now simply put in the username "elonmusk12@gmail" & password "12345" in the 1st "login" page, which is opened inside your 1st browser, which will open the profile of Elon Musk.
